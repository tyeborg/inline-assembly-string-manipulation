# Software Development 2: 

The objective of this program is to receive an input file (preferably text file) and convert/count the contents within that file using a specified argument in the command line. The result of the conversion/counting is translated into an output file called `output.txt`.

This command line tool is incredibly useful for counting the total amount of words present within the file and converting all text within a text file to uppercase and lowercase.

## Command Line Argument Explaination

The command line tool will take arguments that will be passed by the parameters of the program. For example, to convert the content within a given input file to uppercase, then write and display it within an output file, the arguments will look like: 
```bash
convert â€“u -i input.txt -o output.txt
```
